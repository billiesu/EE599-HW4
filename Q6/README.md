# Question 6 (20 Points, Easy)

## Find the k(th) largest element in an unsorted vector and return that value.

    ● You should do this without sorting the vector.

    ● You can assume the input vector `does not have duplicate values`.

    Example 1: Input: [0,2,1,5,6,3] and k = 2 Output: 5 (because the largest is 6, and the second largest is 5)

    Example 2:

    Input: [-2, 3,-1,2,5,6,10] and k =3 Output: 5 (because the largest is 10, 2nd largest is 6, and 3rd largest is 5)

    👉Hint: Heap heap hurray! (Use STL containers)
