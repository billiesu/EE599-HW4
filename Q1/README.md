## ● Filter: Write a function that filters out the odd numbers and keeps the even numbers in a vector (use std::copy_if) and returns a new vector that contains the results.

## ● Map: Write a function that takes a vector of integers as input in and outputs a new vector out where out[i] = in[i] ^ 2 (Use std::transform)

## ● Reduce: Write a function that sums up all elements in a vector (Use std::accumulate)
